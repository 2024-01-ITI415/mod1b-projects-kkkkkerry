 ApplePicker, Mission Demolition and Prototype 1
 The initial idea of my project comes from the game "Temple Run". Players run away from the monster while they can also collect coins on the way. 
 This mechanics can be easily achieved by what we learned in Roll-a-ball. Besides, I also add some "dead zones" which are red blocks in my project. When player collide with them, the game will restart. The condition to win is the same as roll-a-ball.
